If you have this file, well you already got the scripts i assume. But if not, get them from here https://github.com/Atomic-Potato/CPU-State-Manager/tree/main

# SETUP
A. You need either LibreHardwareMonitor (this one works for me) or OpenHardwareMonitor, so the app would be able to read the CPU temp
	1. Install:
		- Libre from here: https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/releases 
		- Open from here: https://openhardwaremonitor.org/downloads/
	2. Extract the app somewhere, you probably only need LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll or OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll file, but idk couldnt bother trying)
	3. Open CPUStateManager.ps1 and set the full path of the DLL file in the hardware_monitor_dll_path parameter

B. Making a power plan: 
	1. Write in the windows search bar "choose a power plan"
	2. Click 'Create a new plan on the left', do whatever it asks
	3. Not important, but i usually go into the advanced settings of the plan and try to toggle everything for power saving
	4. Open CPUStateManager.ps1 and set power_plan_name to the name of the plan you created

# USAGE
A. Running the app
	1. Write in the windows search bar and open: Windows Powershel ISE
	2. Open CPUStateManager.ps1 within the ISE
	3. bam you can now just hit the run button or F5 to run it, and to stop it use the big red square or Ctrl+PageBreak
	4. (Optional) i like setting the script pane to the right, just look for it in the bar at the top, youre a big boi u can figure it out
	5. Once youre done using it, open RestoreDefaultCPUState.ps1 set the default value of the state and the power plan name and run it whenever youre done

The script should work fine with the default values, you probably just need to change the target_temp depending on the game youre playing and maybe the min_cpu_state

aight fam, have fun on da computer o7
